## 🌍 Overview

Toronto faces increasing urban heat island effects and unequal access to green space. GreenGrid Toronto solves this by analyzing multiple environmental and social factors to recommend where tree planting would have the greatest impact.

**The Problem:**
- Urban heat disproportionately affects vulnerable populations
- Limited resources require strategic tree planting decisions
- Complex interplay of heat, tree coverage, demographics, and foot traffic

**Our Solution:**
- AI model trained on 4 diverse datasets (heat maps, tree coverage, vulnerability indices, traffic patterns)
- 98.3% prediction accuracy using Random Forest regression
- Interactive web map for easy visualization and decision-making

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Smart Prioritization**: ML model identifies 1,613 high-priority areas (43.6% of Toronto)
- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Click any neighborhood to see detailed priority scores and contributing factors
- 📊 **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Considers heat exposure, tree coverage, population vulnerability, and foot traffic
- 🔄 **Dynamic Visualization**: Switch between different scoring metrics (priority, heat, trees, vulnerability, footfall)
- 📈 **High Accuracy**: 98.3% R² score with robust cross-validation
- 🌐 **Web-Based**: No installation needed - accessible from any browser

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Data Collection & Integration

We integrate four diverse datasets covering all 3,702 Toronto neighborhoods:

- **Heat Vulnerability Index** (University of Toronto)
  - Heat exposure measurements
  - Tree canopy coverage percentages
  - Population vulnerability scores

- **Traffic Data** (City of Toronto Open Data)
  - 6,318 intersection measurement points
  - Daily pedestrian and vehicle counts
  - Spatially aggregated to neighborhood level

- **Census Boundaries** (Statistics Canada)
  - Geographic framework for analysis
  - Dissemination Area (DA) polygons

### 2. Data Preprocessing

**Key Steps:**
- **Spatial Alignment**: Convert all datasets to consistent coordinate system (EPSG:32617)
- **Missing Value Handling**: Use K-Nearest Neighbors (k=5) to impute missing traffic data for 1,248 neighborhoods
- **Skewness Correction**: Apply log transformation to traffic data (increased model importance from 1% → 17.6%)
- **Normalization**: Scale all features to 0-1 range for fair comparison

### 3. Ground Truth Generation

Since no historical tree planting data exists, we create synthetic labels using domain expert weights:

```
Priority Score = 0.3×heat + 0.3×footfall + 0.2×(1-trees) + 0.2×vulnerability
```

### 4. Machine Learning Model

**Algorithm**: Random Forest Regression
- **Architecture**: 200 decision trees, max depth 15
- **Training**: 80/20 train-test split (2,961 train, 741 test)
- **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation

**Model Discovery:**
The model learned that vulnerability is actually the strongest predictor (44%), adjusting initial expert weights:

| Factor | Initial Weight | Learned Importance | Change |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Vulnerability | 20% | **44.0%** | +24% ↑ |
| Tree Coverage | 20% | 19.9% | ±0% |
| Heat | 30% | 18.5% | -11.5% ↓ |
| Footfall | 30% | 17.6% | -12.4% ↓ |

### 5. Web Visualization

Interactive map built with Leaflet.js:
- Color-coded neighborhoods (yellow = low priority, orange/brown = high priority)
- Click any area for detailed scores
- Switch between different metrics
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

### Feature Importance

The model discovered these factors drive tree planting priority:

1. **Vulnerability** (44.0%) - Most important predictor
   - Captures compound effects of heat + socioeconomic factors
   - Prioritizes environmental justice

2. **Tree Coverage** (19.9%) - Inverted (low trees = higher priority)
   - Identifies gaps in existing canopy

3. **Heat Exposure** (18.5%) - Climate adaptation factor
   - Urban heat island mitigation

4. **Foot Traffic** (17.6%) - Public benefit factor
   - Maximizes community access to shade

### Results Summary

- **Total Areas Analyzed**: 3,702 neighborhoods
- **High Priority (0.67-1.0)**: 1,613 DAs (43.6%)
- **Medium Priority (0.33-0.67)**: 1,927 DAs (52.1%)
- **Low Priority (0.0-0.33)**: 162 DAs (4.4%)

**Key Finding**: Nearly half of Toronto requires high-priority tree planting intervention based on combined environmental and social factors.
